* Changed the signal handler in rclpy to call the original signal handler when receiving SIGINT during a wait on a wait set. (`#191 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/191>`_)
* Added API for counting the number of publishers and subscribers on a topic. (`#183 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/183>`_)
